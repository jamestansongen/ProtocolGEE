//min: 0 specifies the minimum value to be mapped to the color scale for visualization. In this case, it's set to 0.
//max: [0.18, 20, -0.18] specifies the maximum values for each band in the visualization.
//The first value (0.18) represents the maximum value for the 'scale' band, the second value (20) represents the maximum value for the 'offset' band, and the third value (-0.18) represents the maximum value for the second 'scale' band.
//bands: ['scale', 'offset', 'scale'] specifies which bands from the result of the reduction to visualize. In this case, it visualizes the 'scale' band, 'offset' band, and then again the 'scale' band.
